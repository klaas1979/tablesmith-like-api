Use Tablesmith-like API as basic for creating complex nested tables. For more about Tablesmith see the [Tablesmiths Homepage](http://www.mythosa.net/p/tablesmith.html) and the [Forum for TableSmith](https://groups.io/g/tablesmith).

Tablesmith table syntax allows it to create anything from simple tables and nested tables, to complex linked tables with loops, conditionals, parameters and more.

Tablesmith is useful for Character and NPC generation, Solo play, generating Encounters, Inns, Weather and whatever else is needed in your adventure. Within the forum is a files area with a lot tables ranging from simple name tables up to complex content generation of all kind. Tablesmith supports Dataset to store data between calls or rolls and to share data between tables.

### Call Syntax

For all calls the tablename is not case sensitive for convenience. The following is all equal to find a table: `Simple`, `simple`, `SIMPLE`, `sImPle`, and so on. The call `[Simple(1,2)]:2` draws from the table `Simple`, two times (`:2`), setting the first parameter to `1` and the second to `2`. The syntax is:

```tab
# Minimal call, defaults to Group 'Start'
[Tablename]

# Call to other Group
[Tablename.Groupname]

# Call to table with params
[Tablename(params)]

# Full call with all options
[Tablename.Groupname(params)]:times
```

### Tablesmith Form

One macro contained within the added compendium opens the Tablesmith Form, where all loaded tables can be called.

### Macro

The module adds a compendium with simple macros to demonstrate the usage of the API within a Macro.

### Chat Commands

The chat commands `ts` and `tablesmith` can be used to call a table directly by using the standard call syntax as parameter. The enclosing brackets `[]` can be ommitted for convenience.

### Tablesmith Links

Links to Table calls including parameter values can be created with this link syntax:
`@Tablesmith[CallSyntax]{Link Name}` or `@TS[CallSyntax]{Link Name}`. The `{Link Name}` can be omitted, then the tablename is used instead.

Where `CallSyntax` must be in format defined above.

This links are useful to embed in JournalEntries RollTables or Chat Messages to have a shortcut to a Tablesmith call.

### API

TODO define API outside of Foundry

The main method to use in the API is `evaluateTable(expression: string, options?: {...})` where the expression is a valid Table call, that may donate the Group to call, define Parameters and the roll count. I.e. `evaluateTable('[Char.name(1,name)]:5')`. The method takes an option argument, to configure the behaviour, i.e. adding result to chat, to a journal, configuring the journal and more. For the full documentation of options see the source documentation linked above.

## Tablesmith Tables

Tables are created as Journal entries. Journal entries provide an easy way to add and edit a long text document, as needed.

### Loaded tables

All Journal entries where there name ends with `.tab` are loaded. The resulting name is omitting the extension, i.e. `Monsters.tab` results in the Table name `Monsters`, not that Tablenames are case insensitive so the table `simple`and `Simple` are the same and will overwrite each other.
Each table is placed in a folder named after the folder they are contained in. If a table is in no folder it is placed in a `Default` folder.

### Tables in different Journals or Folders

Note that the tablename must be unique over all folders and journals as of now.

### Formatting Tips for Journal Tables

For long tables it is recommended to use `SHIFT+Enter` instead of `Enter` to save some space. This is purely cosmetic, the parser has no problem with mixed newlines.

## Datasets General

TODO a DSStoreFactory implementation must be provided for Dataset to work, document.

There are a number of functions (see below all starting with `DS`) designed to be used with datasets. Datasets are basically tables, consisting of entries that each share the same data fields or attributes or to use table calculation term columns.

Each entry can be thougth of as a row of the table. The table is sorted, with an index donating it's place within the table. The index for the first row or entry starts with `1` (not  with `0`).

An example of something you might put into a dataset would be a collection of loot or monsters or NPCs.
In case of monsters Each entry might be defined by a name, a type, number of hitdice, and attacks. For a very simple monster the dataset could have the following fields or columns: name, type, hitdice, Thaco20, damage. To create a dataset the function `DSCreate` is used, defining the fields including a default value for each. This container can then be filled by adding entries to it.

Entries are added with `DSAdd`. The fields can be defined directly using `DSAdd` or later with `DSSet`.

The table below is a visual representation of an example monster table.

| Index | name | hitdice | thaco20 | damage|
|-------|------|------|--------|------|
|1 | Orc | 2d8+4 | 18 | 1d8+1 |
|2 | Wolf | 1d6 | 19 | 2d4 |
|3 | Dragon | 10d8+34 | 3 | 5d6+12 |

Once a dataset is created, and has items added to it, including setting the values for the fields, it can be used, by retrieving those values using `DSGet`. The Dataset is sortable with `DSSort`. Entries can be searched for with `DSFind`. Singl entries can be removed using `DSRemove`.

Datasets can be persisted using `DSWrite` and later reloaded using `DSRead`.

## Implemented Tablesmith Features

Following are all implemented features of Tablesmith 5.2 and explanations about possible changes and incompatibilites.

### Groups

Groups have the format `:GroupName` for a group with ranges where the number declares their final value or the format `;GroupName` for groups with probability ranges, where the number declares the probability.

```tab
# Standard group
:Group
1,One
2,Two
3-4,Three-Four
```

results in the same table as:

```tab
;Group
1,One
1,Two
2,Three-Four
```

#### Splitting Group Entries / Ranges

Group entries can be split over multiply lines, by prefixing the next line with an underscore `_`.

```tab
:Group
1,First Second
```

is equal to

```tab
:Group
1,First
_ Second
```

#### Dynamic Probabilities

Dynamic Probabilities are not implemented.

#### Defaults Pre- or Postfix

Groups can contain a pre- and/or postfix, that is added to all results:

```tab
:Group
<,There are
>, in the woods
1, Orcs
2, Goblins
```

will result in:
`There are Orcs in the woods` or `There are Goblins in the woods`

### Variables

Variables must be declared before first use:
`%VariableName%,x` where the `%` donates beginning and end of the variable name and the `,` shows start of default value `x`. The default value may be omitted, but the `,`must be present.
Note that the variable default value is not evaluated. A group call to like `%var%,[Group]`will lead to the variable containing the string `[Group]` and not the evaluation of the group.

#### Scope

Variables are scoped to the context of the enclosing Table (not the group) so each Table file has its own context and can name variables the same.

#### Using Variables

Variables can be accessed by using the syntax `%variableName%`. The reference is replaced by the current value. References can be used in nearly any place, within functions and Group calls.

Variables in other tables can be referenced as well using the Syntax `%Tablename!Variablename%`, i.e. `%Char!name%` to reference the variable `name` in Table `Char`.

**Note:** As Tablesmith 5.2 provides no comphrehensive documentation where variables can be referenced this implementation may act differently.

#### Assignment

Variables can be assigned in Group entries by using the syntax `|variableName?X|`. The assignment is taking place and the assignment reference is replaced by an empty string, i.e. leaves no trace in the output. The variable name without `%` must belong to a declared variable. The `?`is the operator for the assignment:

- **|A+5|** - Adds 5 to "A" (Ex: If "A" was 3, it is now 8)
- **|hp-3|** - Subtracts 3 from "hp" (Ex: If "hp" was 4, it is now 1)
- **|gp*2|** - Multiplies "gp" by 2 (Ex: If "gp" was 50, it is now 100)
- **|dmg/2|** - Divides "dmg" by 2 (Ex: If "dmg" was 10, it is now 5)
- **|attr\2|** - Divides "attr" by 2, rounds fractions (Ex: If "attr" was 5, it is now 2)
- **|A>35|** - Assigns 35 to "A", if 35 is greater than A's value
- **|A<14|** - Assigns 14 to "A", if 14 is less than A's value
- **|A& III|** - Concatenates the text " III" to A's value (Ex: If "A" was "Smith", it is now "Smith III")
- **|A=orc|** - Sets "A" equal to the word "orc"

As with reference Variables in other tables may be assigned using the syntax  `|Tablename!Variablename?Value|`, i.e. `|Char!name=Brognar|` to assign the variable `name` the value `Brognar` in Table `Char`.

## Parameters

Tablesmith supports parameters for tables. This can be either passed internally or be gathered as user input before a table is evaluated.

### Parameter Types

Tablesmith supports three types of Parameters:

1. Text
2. List
3. Multi-List

### Passing Parameters to Tables

Parameters may be passed to tables in group calls. This is optional, but if you pass them, the list must match the number of parameters of the table. To pass parameters, you use parentheses after the call `[Table.Start(1,Amelia)]`

The called table is expected to have to parameters declared in the order as listed in parenthesis, i.e:

```tab
%number%,
@number,1,Times?,1,2,3
%name%,
@name,Brognar,Enter name:
```

The parameter `number` is assigned the `1` and the parameter `name` is assigned `Amelia`.

Other valid calls are:

- `[Table.Start(,Amelia)]` number default, name `Amelia`
- `[Table.Start(1,)]` number `1`, name default
- `[Table.Start(,)]` both default
- `[Table.Start]` both default

It is not possible to assign values to variables, without a parameter defined.

## Miscellaneous

### Number of Rolls

A Table call can donate how many rolls should be done by using the syntax `[TableCall]:X` where `TableCall` can be any valid call and `X` donates the number of roles to make.

### Re Roll Tag

The re roll Tag for a Table-Group call `[~Table.Group]` is working within the Tablesmith Form. Each re-rollable Group has a small icon in front that can be clicked for a re-roll of this particular group.

For other calls the Result object can be used to trigger a re roll programatically.

### Printing Special Character

The custom build parser allows a lot of characters. For compatibility the following special characters must be escaped to be printed:

- percent sign `%` or
- square brackets `[` or `]`

Precede the character with the slash character `/`.

### Pre-Generation Directives

No pre generation directives are implemented.

## Tablesmith functions

Tablesmith functionnames are case insensitive, i.e.  `If`, `if`, `iF`, and `IF` are all the same.

See the [FUNCTIONS](./FUNCTIONS.md) file for a documentation of all functions.
